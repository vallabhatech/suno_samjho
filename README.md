git clone https://github.com/your-username/suno-samjho.git
cd suno-samjho
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Supabase & Environment Variables  

This app uses **Supabase** for authentication and database. You'll need to set up your own Supabase project or use the shared development credentials.

#### Option A: Use Shared Dev Credentials (Recommended for Contributors)
Request access to the shared development Supabase project by:
1. Opening an issue with the label `access-request`
2. A maintainer will add you to the dev project and share credentials

#### Option B: Create Your Own Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new project
3. Navigate to **Settings → API** to find your credentials
4. Enable **Email/Password** and **Google OAuth** in **Authentication → Providers**

#### Create the `.env` File
Create a `.env` file in the project root (this file is gitignored):
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit your `.env` file!** It contains sensitive credentials.

---

### 4️⃣ Run the App  

#### Web (Easiest for Development)
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

#### Android
```bash
flutter run -d android
```

#### iOS (macOS only)
```bash
flutter run -d ios
```

#### All Available Devices
```bash
